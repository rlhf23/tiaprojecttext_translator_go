To run it, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it from there.

Remember, since it's a command-line application, you will need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable on the Windows machine before running it. You can do this in Command Prompt with:

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
```
Or in PowerShell with:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-secret-api-key"
```
After that, you can run the program by simply typing translator.exe.
